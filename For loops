For loops; Helps you repeat text, info, etc

# make a list
power_rangers = ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Pink", "Black", "Green"]

print("There is a" ,power_rangers[0], "Power Ranger")

print("There is a" ,power_rangers[1], "Power Ranger")

print("There is a" ,power_rangers[2], "Power Ranger")

Result: 
There is a Red Power Ranger
There is a Blue Power Ranger
There is a Yellow Power Ranger

#Using for loops, i = Number of times it loops. The result will loop until the number of range is reached.
The "i"can be anything you want to name e.g power_rangers the i can be "ranger"

for i in range(6):
    print(i+1)
    
Result: 
1
2
3
4
5
6

# Using multiply function to get the timetables of 7
i = Number of times it loops

multiplier = 7
for i in range(10):
    result = multiplier * (i+1)
    print(result)
    
Result:7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70

** Now to loop text

# make a list
power_rangers = ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Pink", "Black", "Green"]

#Using for loops, ranger = Number of times it loops

for ranger in power_rangers:
    print(ranger)
    
Result:Red, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Black, Green

** Looping with string

# make a list
power_rangers = ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Pink", "Black", "Green"]

#Using for loops, ranger = Number of times it loops

for ranger in power_rangers:
    print("There is a" ,ranger, "Power Ranger")
    
 Result: 
There is a Red Power Ranger
There is a Blue Power Ranger
There is a Yellow Power Ranger
There is a Pink Power Ranger
There is a Black Power Ranger
There is a Green Power Ranger
