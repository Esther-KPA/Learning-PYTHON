#Examples:

**Instead of == we use != AKA (Not equal) so that input_user is not equal to magic_word
  Also COLON (:) Cannot be forgotten
  
magic_word = "Please"
input_user = input("What is the magic word? ")

while input_user != magic_word:
    input_user = input("What is the magic word? ")

print("You are welcome! ")

Result:
What is the magic word? Essie
What is the magic word? John
What is the magic word? Please
You are welcome!

*** Guessing game example

from random import randrange

#get a random number
random_number = randrange(1,11)

# print number
print(random_number)

# get a number from user
guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")

#typecast to int
guess = int(guess)

#check
while random_number != guess:
    print(guess, "is not the one! ")
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10? ")
    guess = int(guess)

print("Well done! The number was" ,random_number)

Result:
