#Examples:

**Instead of == we use != AKA (Not equal) so that input_user is not equal to magic_word
  Also COLON (:) Cannot be forgotten
  
magic_word = "Please"
input_user = input("What is the magic word? ")

while input_user != magic_word:
    input_user = input("What is the magic word? ")

print("You are welcome! ")

Result:
What is the magic word? Essie
What is the magic word? John
What is the magic word? Please
You are welcome!

*** Guessing game example

# import randrage
from random import randrange

#get a random number
random_number = randrange(1,11)

# print number
print(random_number)

# get a number from user
guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")

#typecast to int
guess = int(guess)

#check
while random_number != guess:
    print(guess, "is not the one! ")

print("Well done! The number was" ,random_number)

Result:

Guess a number between 1 and 10: 7
7 is not the one! 
Guess a number between 1 and 10? 8
Well done! The number was 8


*** Using "If" within "While loops to give hint in "guess game"

# import randrage
from random import randrange

#get a random number
random_number = randrange(1,11)

# get a number from user
guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 50: ")

#typecast to int
guess = int(guess)

#check  : The sign is "greater than" because we can print" 
and give hint that it should be lower else: print lower if the number 
to be guessed is still low
while random_number != guess:
    if(guess > random_number):
        print("The random number is lower")
    else:
        print("The random number is lower")

    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 50? ")
    guess = int(guess)

print("Well done! The number was" ,random_number)

Result:
(base) estheramanya@Esthers-MacBook ~ % python While-loop.py
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 20
The random number is lower
Guess a number between 1 and 50? 19
The random number is lower
Guess a number between 1 and 50? 17
The random number is lower
Guess a number between 1 and 50? 10
The random number is lower
Guess a number between 1 and 50? 9
The random number is lower
Guess a number between 1 and 50? 8
Well done! The number was 8
